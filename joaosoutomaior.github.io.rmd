### About

I am a fourth-year PhD student ---at the candidacy level--- in the [Sociology of Education program](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/programs/sociology-education) in the Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science and Humanities at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development. My research investigates the formation of educational inequalities within educational institutions, particularly along dimensions of race and class. Two primary goals inform such investigations. First, to rigorously quantify the extent to which organizational practices produce race- and class-based educational inequalities. Second, to understand the underlying mechanisms through which educational practices produce these inequalities. To address these goals, I rely on a variety of quantitative methods, with a primary focus on agent-based simulation approaches, hoping to advance the use of computational methods within the sociology of education. 

I am originally from São Paulo, Brazil. I received my BA in economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017. After my undergraduate studies, I started as an economics doctoral student at the CUNY Graduate Center, where I studied for a year before transferring to NYU.

*A note on names:* for publication purposes, I use a hyphenated version of my last name: João M. Souto-Maior

This is one of the papers which constitute my doctoral dissertation. The purpose of the project is to identify the mechanisms generating Black-White academic disparities in integrated school settings. The project constructs a series of qualitatively-informed agent-based models that highlight the mechanisms generating black-white advanced course-taking inequalities within schools. Models show how the racial composition of schools and different tracking systems influence the salience of the generative mechanisms. Models are constructed, evaluated and applied to national data from American schools.

We investigate and quantify the extent to which observed Black-White enrollment disparities in Advanced Placement mathematics courses are "unjustified" by the main principle governing student placement decisions---i.e., students' academic preparedness. Using detailed administrative data from New York paper high schools, we use a machine-learning-based approach to construct our own measure of academic preparedness and find that the under-representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics is not fully explained by students' differences in academic preparedness

This paper aims at filling the gap of descriptive investigations of within-school educational inequalities in Brazil. Using publicly-available data from national high school exams, I rely on multilevel-models of student performance with school- and race-specific random effects to highlight the school-level factors correlated with within-school inequalities. An ultimate goal of the project is to allow its academic findings to be accessible to the general public---journalists, policymakers and those who wish to invest in better conditions for learning in Brazilian schools. A final product of this work is the publishing of an accessible and interactive dashboard application, which maps race- and class-based within-school inequalities across Brazilian schools, allowing users to gain both a broad and school-specific view of the study's results.

This introductory course is designed to prepare undergraduate &
master’s level students to use statistics for data analysis. This course covers descriptive and
inferential statistics; including frequency distributions, graphs, measures of central tendency,
measures of variability, sampling, probability, z-score, the normal distribution, and tests of
hypothesis such as t-tests, ANOVA, linear correlation and regression, and chi-squared analysis.
Effect size, study designs (observational and experimental) and research concepts (association
and causation; confounding and interaction) will also be addressed. The IBM-SPSS software will
be used for data analysis.

The course is designed to introduce students to the practice of research and creative work, and
its implications for society. The course has two components: the work you do as an assistant on
faculty projects, and your participation in the small group seminar. In the school year 2016-17, the
seminar is dedicated to the theme: research, creative work and the public good. We will spend
the year critically exploring this theme across different disciplines, and touching on a range of
societal problems. The theme is to provoke reflection in our research or creative work experiences, and in the
different parts of the world we inhabit. Come prepared to share your thinking on the topics
introduced. Through discussions, activities and assignments you may learn as much from one
another as you learn through your research project.

The doctoral comprehensive examination in the Sociology of Education program is intended for students to achieve and demonstrate a comprehensive working knowledge of a large subfield of sociology. We trust that the knowledge facilitated by the exam will serve our students well as they write their dissertations and continue into subsequent stages of their careers. The exam consists of an oral examination in two areas: (1) a list of 18 books and articles that our program considers to be foundational to the field of Sociology of Education and (2) approximately 32 additional readings (for a total of approximately 50 readings on the comps list), both theoretical and empirical, in an area of the student’s specialization.

In this independent study, my goal was to review some of the key explanations for within-school achievement gaps in the sociology of education literature. I am particularly interested in texts discussing how school contexts and school characteristics contribute to or mitigate the production of academic inequality within schools. My literature review focuses on four key themes: (1) peer networks, (2) student course taking, (3) teacher expectations and (4) parental influence.
