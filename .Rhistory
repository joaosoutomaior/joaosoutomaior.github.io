The course is designed to introduce students to the practice of research and creative work, and
its implications for society. The course has two components: the work you do as an assistant on
faculty projects, and your participation in the small group seminar. In the school year 2016-17, the
seminar is dedicated to the theme: research, creative work and the public good. We will spend
the year critically exploring this theme across different disciplines, and touching on a range of
societal problems. The theme is to provoke reflection in our research or creative work experiences, and in the
different parts of the world we inhabit. Come prepared to share your thinking on the topics
introduced. Through discussions, activities and assignments you may learn as much from one
another as you learn through your research project.
