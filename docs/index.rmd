Welcome to my website!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar (New Map of Life Fellow) at the [Stanford Center on Longevity](https://longevity.stanford.edu/).

I am an educational data scientist who investigates how unequal educational opportunities emerge --- and how they might be mitigated. My research centers on two core areas: (1) how organizational decisions contribute to or reduce inequality among students within the same institution; (2) how learning during adulthood can help individuals navigate a rapidly changing labor market and advance social and economic mobility. Trained in computational social sciences, I am excited about how new methodological approaches can help us leverage new data sources and generate new insights. I use tools such as agent-based modeling, machine learning, and large-scale data analysis, to produce rigorous research that can inform policy and practice.

I am originally from São Paulo, Brazil. I hold a Ph.D. in Sociology of Education from the New York University (2023) and a B.A. in Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2017).

**Abstract:** This article investigates mechanism-based explanations for a well-known macro-level pattern in sociology of education, namely, that Black-White unequal access to advanced coursework is the highest in racially diverse and majority-White schools. The study proposes that school racial composition (defined as the share of Whites) could influence the emergence of Black-White course-taking inequalities through the combination of two factors: (a), the relevance of network-based resources for advanced enrollment; and (b), the known relationship between racial composition and network structure. Through an empirically informed agent-based model, this study provides support for the proposed theoretical pathway and shows that, when combined with empirically representative structural inequalities, this racial composition effect can help explaining the pattern of interest. Possible policy implications are discussed.

**Abstract:** Whether racial disparities in enrollment in advanced high school coursework can be attributed to differences in prior academic preparation is a central question in sociological research and education policy. However, previous investigations face methodological limitations, for they compare race-specific enrollment rates of students after adjusting for characteristics only partially related to their academic preparedness for advanced coursework. Informed by a recently-developed statistical technique, we propose and estimate a novel measure of students' academic preparedness and use administrative data from a large, urban, public school system to measure differences in AP mathematics enrollment rates among similarly prepared students of different races. We find that preexisting differences in academic preparation do not fully explain the under-representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics. Our results imply that achieving equal opportunities for AP enrollment not only requires equalizing earlier academic experiences, but also addressing inequities that emerge from coursework placement processes.

**Abstract:** Sociologists increasingly highlight the role of opportunity hoarding in the formation of Black-White educational inequalities. Informed by this literature, this article unpacks the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the hoarding of educational resources emerges within schools. It develops a qualitatively informed agent-based model which captures Black and White students' competition for a valuable school resource: advanced coursework. In contrast to traditional accounts --- which explain the emergence of hoarding through the actions of Whites that keep valuable resources within White communities --- simulations, perhaps surprisingly, show hoarding to arise even when Whites do not play the role of hoarders of resources. Behind this result is the fact that a structural inequality (i.e., racial differences in social class), and not action-driven hoarding, is the necessary condition for hoarding to emerge. Findings, therefore, illustrate that common action-driven understandings of opportunity hoarding can overlook the structural foundations behind this important phenomenon. Possible policy implications are discussed.

**Abstract:** Whether selection processes contribute to group-level disparities or merely reflect pre-existing inequalities is an important societal question. In the context of observational data, researchers, concerned about omitted-variable bias, assess selection-contributing inequality via a kitchen-sink approach, comparing selection outcomes of different-group individuals net of various characteristics. We introduce a conceptual framework that clearly defines the quantity of interest and argue that researchers should only control for the extent to which individuals meet selection criteria. Informed by this framework, we use directed acyclic graphs and structural equation modeling to show that traditional practices can inaccurately represent selection-contributing inequality because chosen controls frequently capture selection-irrelevant characteristics, which we define as the correlated proxy problem. Using Black-White disproportionality in special education as a case study, we show that typical practices of using test scores as covariates likely drastically underestimate the influence of selection-contributing inequality to Black over-representation in special education.

**Abstract:** The under-representation of Black students in special education relative to White students has been identified by recent research as a key equity consideration. We provide six quantitative critiques of the extant literature that should give pause to researchers and policymakers who have concluded the under-representation in special education for Black students is a robust quantitative result. These six critiques are: (i) use of test scores as controls to create non-equivalent comparison groups, (ii) use of colliders as controls, (iii) overuse of same data exaggerates robustness, (iv) overused data are not accurate samples of special education population, (v) over-reliance on regression adjustment over other matching-type estimators, and (vi) inattention to generalizability and heterogeneity of special education placement differences. We identify specific research questions and potential approaches that are needed before firm conclusions about under-representation in special education can be reached.

Throughout the semester we will look at a number of important issues in contemporary US schooling
through the lens of history. How have these issues developed over the last three hundred years? What has changed? Who have the prime change agents been? We will also discuss all of these issues as they are in schools today. What is happening now? What should happen? What are the forces for change—for the better or for worse?
<br>
<br>
For those who are preparing for careers in teaching, or for students who are interested in education as a field of study (who may want to be journalists or researchers or activists in the field), this course should provide important background historical context. For students of history or politics or who bring a general interest to the questions of this course, Introduction to U.S. Education is designed to help us understand current political, pedagogical, and economic debates.

College in the United States is expensive, really expensive. For 2022-23, a 120 credit undergraduate degree costs at least $200,000 at many private elite universities (like NYU) – plus all sorts of miscellaneous fees, lodging and food charges, books and more. Why does it cost so much? Is it a good deal? Why do so many high school students apply to study at such expensive institutions when there are cheaper alternatives available? Who is able to attend, and who is excluded? Why do college costs keep rising so fast? Shouldn’t college be free? The purpose of this course is to provide answers to these kinds of questions. It will introduce students to a range of economic concepts and empirical evidence that speaks to: the value of higher education for individuals and for societies; federal, state, and institutional financial aid policies; university budgets and spending priorities. We will consider individual student, institutional and societal perspectives.

The doctoral comprehensive examination in the Sociology of Education program is intended for students to achieve and demonstrate a comprehensive working knowledge of a large subfield of sociology. We trust that the knowledge facilitated by the exam will serve our students well as they write their dissertations and continue into subsequent stages of their careers. The exam consists of an oral examination in two areas: (1) a list of 18 books and articles that our program considers to be foundational to the field of Sociology of Education and (2) approximately 32 additional readings (for a total of approximately 50 readings on the comps list), both theoretical and empirical, in an area of the student’s specialization.
