Welcome to my website!

I am a postdoctoral associate (effective in August, 2023) in the [Institute of Human Development and Social Change](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/ihdsc) at the New York University. I am on the 2023-24 job market.

In my research, I rely on innovative methodological approaches---such as qualitatively informed agent-based models and machine learning techniques---to re-examine “old” questions in education
research. Doing so, I hope to improve the quality of evidence on questions of great
relevance to education policy and practice. In particular, I concentrate on questions related to the organizational decisions of educational institutions and how they impact unequal educational opportunities across race and class lines. 

In my dissertation (advised by L'Heureux Lewis-McCoy and with support from [NYU's agent-based modeling lab](https://publichealth.nyu.edu/research-scholarship/centers-labs-initiatives/agent-based-modeling-lab)), I designed qualitatively-informed agent-based models to address questions concerning the emergence of educational inequalities---defined as access to advanced coursework---between Black and White students who attend the same school. I investigated the role of racial composition on Black students' educational opportunities and explored how educational opportunities are hoarded within schools. 

As a postdoctoral researcher, I work with Rachel Fish (NYU) and Kenneth Shores (University of Delaware) investigating methodological issues concerning the existing quantitative evidence on the disproportionate representation of Black students in special education programs.

<p1>Research agenda</p1>

In my research, I rely on innovative methodological approaches to re-examining “old” questions in education research. Doing so, I hope to improve the quality of evidence on some of the key questions to education policy and practice. In particular, I concentrate on questions related to the organization of educational institutions, looking at how organizational decisions impact the formation of racial and socioeconomic inequalities in education opportunity. This work is defined by two main areas of research, detailed below.

Understanding the organizational behavior of schools has long been a challenging task since school’s internal dynamics are shaped by the decisions of and social interactions between multiple actors, such as students, families, administrators and school staff. Because of this dependence on the social dynamics which emerge from interdependent individual action, one of my research focuses is to apply insights from complex systems approaches in innovative and creative ways to address important questions within school organization research.

Among the central decisions which educational institutions have to make is the one of sorting students. Schools, for example, often need to decide which students are allowed to: pass courses; advance to subsequent grades; take advanced courses. Similarly, selective institutions (such as selective high schools and selective colleges/universities) need to sort students when making admissions decisions, sorting the pool of applicants into those who are offered admission and those who are not. One of my research focuses is to improve current methodological strategies to examine the possible existence of biases in these sorting processes.

**Abstract:** This article investigates mechanism-based explanations for a well-known empirical pattern in sociology of education, namely, that Black-White unequal access to school resources -- defined as advanced coursework -- is the highest in racially diverse and majority-White schools. Through an empirically calibrated and validated agent-based model, this study explores the dynamics of two qualitatively informed mechanisms, showing (1) that we have reason to believe that the presence of White students in school can influence the emergence of Black-White advanced enrollment disparities and (2) that such influence can represent another possible explanation for the macro-level pattern of interest. Results contribute to current scholarly accounts of within-school inequalities, shedding light into policy strategies to improve the educational experiences of Black students in racially integrated settings.

**Abstract:** Whether racial disparities in enrollment in advanced high school coursework can be attributed to differences in prior academic preparation is a central empirical question in sociological research,  with important implications for education policy. 
However, the regression-based approaches to this question that are predominant in the literature suffer significant methodological limitations by implicitly assuming that students are similarly prepared if and only if they have similar values on a selected set of academic background measures.
Here, we provide a general technique to estimate enrollment disparities in advanced coursework between similarly-prepared students of different races that is less vulnerable to these limitations. 
We introduce a novel measure of academic preparedness, a student's *ex-ante* probability of success in the course, directly adjust for this single measure in a regression model of enrollment on race, and assess the robustness of estimated disparities to potential unmeasured confounding. 
We illustrate this approach by analyzing Black-White disparities in AP mathematics enrollment in a large, urban, public school system in the United States.
We find that preexisting differences in academic preparation do not fully explain the under-representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics, and contrast our results with those from traditional approaches.

<p3>Hoarding without hoarders: unpacking the emergence of opportunity hoarding within schools</p3>

**Abstract:** Sociologists of education increasingly highlight the role of opportunity hoarding in the formation of Black-White educational inequalities. Informed by this literature, this article unpacks the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the hoarding of educational resources emerges within schools. It develops a qualitatively informed agent-based model which captures Black and White students' competition for a valuable school resource: advanced coursework. In contrast to traditional accounts -- which explain the emergence of hoarding through the actions of Whites that keep valuable resources within White communities -- simulations, perhaps surprisingly, show hoarding to arise even when Whites do not play the role of hoarders of resources. Behind this result is the fact that a structural inequality (i.e., racial differences in social class) -- and not action-driven hoarding -- is the necessary condition for hoarding to emerge. Findings, therefore, illustrate that common action-driven understandings of opportunity hoarding can overlook the structural foundations behind this important phenomenon. Policy implications are discussed.

I explore the school- and district-level characteristics under which the agent-based model constructed in "Black-White advanced enrollment inequalities and the share of White students in school: an agent-based modeling investigation" performs best, providing insights on circumstances under which the inequality-producing mechanisms considered in the model tend to be more salient.

This paper aims at filling the gap of descriptive investigations of within-school educational inequalities in Brazil. Using publicly-available data from national high school exams, I rely on multilevel-models of student performance with school- and race-specific random effects to highlight the school-level factors correlated with within-school inequalities. An ultimate goal of the project is to allow its academic findings to be accessible to the general public---journalists, policymakers and those who wish to invest in better conditions for learning in Brazilian schools. A final product of this work is the publishing of an accessible and interactive dashboard application, which maps race- and class-based within-school inequalities across Brazilian schools, allowing users to gain both a broad and school-specific view of the study's results.

Throughout the semester we will look at a number of important issues in contemporary US schooling
through the lens of history. How have these issues developed over the last three hundred years? What has changed? Who have the prime change agents been? We will also discuss all of these issues as they are in schools today. What is happening now? What should happen? What are the forces for change—for the better or for worse?
<br>
<br>
For those who are preparing for careers in teaching, or for students who are interested in education as a field of study (who may want to be journalists or researchers or activists in the field), this course should provide important background historical context. For students of history or politics or who bring a general interest to the questions of this course, Introduction to U.S. Education is designed to help us understand current political, pedagogical, and economic debates.

College in the United States is expensive, really expensive. For 2022-23, a 120 credit undergraduate degree costs at least $200,000 at many private elite universities (like NYU) – plus all sorts of miscellaneous fees, lodging and food charges, books and more. Why does it cost so much? Is it a good deal? Why do so many high school students apply to study at such expensive institutions when there are cheaper alternatives available? Who is able to attend, and who is excluded? Why do college costs keep rising so fast? Shouldn’t college be free? The purpose of this course is to provide answers to these kinds of questions. It will introduce students to a range of economic concepts and empirical evidence that speaks to: the value of higher education for individuals and for societies; federal, state, and institutional financial aid policies; university budgets and spending priorities. We will consider individual student, institutional and societal perspectives.

The purpose of the project is to identify and explore the dynamics of the mechanisms generating Black-White advanced course-taking inequalities within schools. The project constructs a series of qualitatively-informed agent-based models which and explore the conditions which foster/hinder the emergence of these inequalities. Models are empirically calibrated and validated according to national data from American schools.

The doctoral comprehensive examination in the Sociology of Education program is intended for students to achieve and demonstrate a comprehensive working knowledge of a large subfield of sociology. We trust that the knowledge facilitated by the exam will serve our students well as they write their dissertations and continue into subsequent stages of their careers. The exam consists of an oral examination in two areas: (1) a list of 18 books and articles that our program considers to be foundational to the field of Sociology of Education and (2) approximately 32 additional readings (for a total of approximately 50 readings on the comps list), both theoretical and empirical, in an area of the student’s specialization.

In this independent study, my goal was to review some of the key explanations for within-school achievement gaps in the sociology of education literature. I am particularly interested in texts discussing how school contexts and school characteristics contribute to or mitigate the production of academic inequality within schools. My literature review focuses on four key themes: (1) peer networks, (2) student course taking, (3) teacher expectations and (4) parental influence.
