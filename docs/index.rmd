Welcome to my website!

I am an educational data scientist who investigates the formation of unequal learning opportunities across multiple stages of the life course and how these disparities might be mitigated. My research centers on two core areas: 

* **within-school inequality:** how organizational decisions contribute to or reduce inequality among students within the same institution?
* **learning across the life course:** how can adult learning and training help individuals navigate a rapidly changing labor market and advance social and economic mobility? 

As a quantitative researcher trained in the growing field of computational social science, I am excited about leveraging new datasets and methodologies --- such as machine learning and agent-based simulations --- to produce rigorous evidence on questions of clear policy concern. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar (New Map of Life Fellow) at the [Stanford Center on Longevity](https://longevity.stanford.edu/), where I work on a [project](https://learningsociety.io/) led by Professor Mitchell Stevens aimed at reimagining the existing educational infrastructure to more effectively integrate learning opportunities across the life course.

I am originally from São Paulo, Brazil. I hold a Ph.D. in Sociology of Education from the New York University (2023) and a B.A. in Economics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2017).

**Abstract:** This paper seeks to clarify the concept of opportunity hoarding as it applies to Black-White educational inequalities. Two prevailing interpretations stand out: a group-disparity interpretation, which treats opportunity hoarding as any process generating group differences, and an exclusionary-behaviors interpretation, which emphasizes how White actors secure advantages through exclusionary practices. I argue that the former is too broad — remaining vague about the underlying mechanisms — and the latter too narrow, overlooking what I term hoarding without hoarders, i.e., opportunity hoarding that arises even in the absence of exclusionary behaviors. I define opportunity hoarding as the relational processes that generate racial penalties in access to resources, i.e., disparities unexplained by previously formed individual differences. Using an agent-based model of racial disparities in advanced course-taking, this paper shows how network diffusion — under segregation, consolidation of race and socioeconomic status, and temporal constraints — can produce racial penalties even when behaviors are race-neutral. The framework highlights the need for scholars and policymakers to look beyond exclusionary acts in the hoarding of valuable resources.

**Abstract:** This article investigates mechanism-based explanations for a well-known macro-level pattern in sociology of education, namely, that Black-White unequal access to advanced coursework is the highest in racially diverse and majority-White schools. The study proposes that school racial composition (defined as the share of Whites) could influence the emergence of Black-White course-taking inequalities through the combination of two factors: (a), the relevance of network-based resources for advanced enrollment; and (b), the known relationship between racial composition and network structure. Through an empirically informed agent-based model, this study provides support for the proposed theoretical pathway and shows that, when combined with empirically representative structural inequalities, this racial composition effect can help explaining the pattern of interest. Possible policy implications are discussed.

**Abstract:** The under-representation of Black students in special education relative to White students has been identified by recent research as a key equity consideration. We provide six quantitative critiques of the extant literature that should give pause to researchers and policymakers who have concluded the under-representation in special education for Black students is a robust quantitative result. These six critiques are: (i) use of test scores as controls to create non-equivalent comparison groups, (ii) use of colliders as controls, (iii) overuse of same data exaggerates robustness, (iv) overused data are not accurate samples of special education population, (v) over-reliance on regression adjustment over other matching-type estimators, and (vi) inattention to generalizability and heterogeneity of special education placement differences. We identify specific research questions and potential approaches that are needed before firm conclusions about under-representation in special education can be reached.

<p3>Differences in academic preparedness do not fully explain Black-White enrollment disparities in advanced high school coursework </p3>

**Abstract:** Whether racial disparities in enrollment in advanced high school coursework can be attributed to differences in prior academic preparation is a central question in sociological research and education policy. However, previous investigations face methodological limitations, for they compare race-specific enrollment rates of students after adjusting for characteristics only partially related to their academic preparedness for advanced coursework. Informed by a recently-developed statistical technique, we propose and estimate a novel measure of students' academic preparedness and use administrative data from a large, urban, public school system to measure differences in AP mathematics enrollment rates among similarly prepared students of different races. We find that preexisting differences in academic preparation do not fully explain the under-representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics. Our results imply that achieving equal opportunities for AP enrollment not only requires equalizing earlier academic experiences, but also addressing inequities that emerge from coursework placement processes.

**Abstract:** Racial disproportionality in special education is a contested policy space. Federal oversight has traditionally focused on minority over-representation through IDEA’s significant disproportionality framework. However, observational studies report that Black students appear under-identified based on a canonical model that regresses special education receipt on race and controls, notably prior achievement and socioeconomic status (SES). Drawing on this evidence, recent federal proposals would scale back oversight tied to significant disproportionality determinations. We formalize an IDEA-aligned estimand and show analytically that the canonical model recovers it only under strong assumptions. Most notably, it requires that the residual Black--White achievement gap net of SES reflects a gap in disability-related need rather than residual differences in opportunity to learn and other exclusionary factors. In simulations calibrated to empirically plausible environments, the canonical model overstates Black under-representation to an extent sufficient to fully account for previously reported levels. This bias stems from over-controlling for components of social inequality IDEA regards as distinct from disability. We further show popular sensitivity analyses perform poorly in addressing this issue. The implication is that negative coefficients from standard adjustments should not be interpreted as evidence of IDEA-aligned under-service without designs that better separate disability from opportunity.

Throughout the semester we will look at a number of important issues in contemporary US schooling
through the lens of history. How have these issues developed over the last three hundred years? What has changed? Who have the prime change agents been? We will also discuss all of these issues as they are in schools today. What is happening now? What should happen? What are the forces for change—for the better or for worse?
<br>
<br>
For those who are preparing for careers in teaching, or for students who are interested in education as a field of study (who may want to be journalists or researchers or activists in the field), this course should provide important background historical context. For students of history or politics or who bring a general interest to the questions of this course, Introduction to U.S. Education is designed to help us understand current political, pedagogical, and economic debates.

College in the United States is expensive, really expensive. For 2022-23, a 120 credit undergraduate degree costs at least $200,000 at many private elite universities (like NYU) – plus all sorts of miscellaneous fees, lodging and food charges, books and more. Why does it cost so much? Is it a good deal? Why do so many high school students apply to study at such expensive institutions when there are cheaper alternatives available? Who is able to attend, and who is excluded? Why do college costs keep rising so fast? Shouldn’t college be free? The purpose of this course is to provide answers to these kinds of questions. It will introduce students to a range of economic concepts and empirical evidence that speaks to: the value of higher education for individuals and for societies; federal, state, and institutional financial aid policies; university budgets and spending priorities. We will consider individual student, institutional and societal perspectives.

The doctoral comprehensive examination in the Sociology of Education program is intended for students to achieve and demonstrate a comprehensive working knowledge of a large subfield of sociology. We trust that the knowledge facilitated by the exam will serve our students well as they write their dissertations and continue into subsequent stages of their careers. The exam consists of an oral examination in two areas: (1) a list of 18 books and articles that our program considers to be foundational to the field of Sociology of Education and (2) approximately 32 additional readings (for a total of approximately 50 readings on the comps list), both theoretical and empirical, in an area of the student’s specialization.

In this independent study, my goal was to review some of the key explanations for within-school achievement gaps in the sociology of education literature.
