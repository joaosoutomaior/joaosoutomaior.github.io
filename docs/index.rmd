### About

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Sociology of Education](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/programs/sociology-education) in the [Department of Applied Statistics, Social Science and Humanities](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/applied-statistics-social-science-and-humanities) at [New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/). I am on the 2022-23 job market.

I am interested in understanding how the organization of schools influences the learning experiences of students and how it shapes the emergence of within-school educational inequalities along dimensions of race and class. My research applies rigorous computational methods---ranging from qualitatively-informed agent-based models to machine-learning approaches---in innovative and creative ways to the study of school organization, providing valuable policy insights on how to better structure schools to ensure the provision of equal educational opportunities for students from all backgrounds. Broadly, this work fits within the sub-fields of Sociology of Education, Computational Social Sciences and Analytical Sociology.


I am originally from São Paulo, Brazil. I received my BA in economics from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://econ.wisc.edu/) in 2017. After my undergraduate studies, I started as an economics doctoral student at [The Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/economics), where I studied for a year before transferring to NYU.

*A note on names:* for publication purposes, I use a hyphenated version of my last name: João M. Souto-Maior

**Previous title:** Black-White advanced enrollment inequalities and the share of White students in school: an agent-based modeling investigation
<br>
**Abstract:** This article investigates mechanism-based explanations for a puzzling finding in education research, namely, that Black-White unequal access to school resources---defined as advanced coursework---is the highest in racially integrated settings. Because the advanced enrollment process depends on different interaction-based processes, this study hypothesizes that the known relationship between relative group size and racial homophily provides a possible explanatory path. Through the construction and analysis of a qualitatively informed, empirically calibrated and validated agent-based model of the advanced enrollment processes, this study highlights two mechanisms that contribute to this puzzling link. First, the diffusion of parental information resources within students' and parents' networks. Second, the diffusion of beliefs about social and academic belonging in advanced courses within students' networks. By examining the model features shaping the dynamics of these mechanisms, the study also sheds light into policy strategies to improve Black students' access to school resources in racially integrated settings.

**Abstract:** Whether US high school Advanced Placement enrollment processes favor some race groups over others is a central empirical question in educational research and policy.However, previous investigations face  methodological limitations, for they compare enrollment rates of students after adjusting for characteristics only partially related to academic preparedness for advanced coursework. Informed by a recently-developed statistical technique, we propose and estimate a novel measure of students' academic preparedness and use administrative data from a large, urban, public school system to measure ``preparedness-adjusted" Black-White disparities in AP mathematics enrollment, i.e., differences in enrollment rates among similarly prepared students of different races. We find that preexisting differences in academic preparation do not fully explain the under-representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics. Our results imply that achieving equal opportunities for AP enrollment not only require equalizing earlier academic experiences, but also addressing inequities that emerge from coursework placement processes.

This paper aims at filling the gap of descriptive investigations of within-school educational inequalities in Brazil. Using publicly-available data from national high school exams, I rely on multilevel-models of student performance with school- and race-specific random effects to highlight the school-level factors correlated with within-school inequalities. An ultimate goal of the project is to allow its academic findings to be accessible to the general public---journalists, policymakers and those who wish to invest in better conditions for learning in Brazilian schools. A final product of this work is the publishing of an accessible and interactive dashboard application, which maps race- and class-based within-school inequalities across Brazilian schools, allowing users to gain both a broad and school-specific view of the study's results.

Throughout the semester we will look at a number of important issues in contemporary US schooling
through the lens of history. How have these issues developed over the last three hundred years? What has changed? Who have the prime change agents been? We will also discuss all of these issues as they are in schools today. What is happening now? What should happen? What are the forces for change—for the better or for worse?
<br>
<br>
For those who are preparing for careers in teaching, or for students who are interested in education as a field of study (who may want to be journalists or researchers or activists in the field), this course should provide important background historical context. For students of history or politics or who bring a general interest to the questions of this course, Introduction to U.S. Education is designed to help us understand current political, pedagogical, and economic debates.

College in the United States is expensive, really expensive. For 2022-23, a 120 credit undergraduate degree costs at least $200,000 at many private elite universities (like NYU) – plus all sorts of miscellaneous fees, lodging and food charges, books and more. Why does it cost so much? Is it a good deal? Why do so many high school students apply to study at such expensive institutions when there are cheaper alternatives available? Who is able to attend, and who is excluded? Why do college costs keep rising so fast? Shouldn’t college be free? The purpose of this course is to provide answers to these kinds of questions. It will introduce students to a range of economic concepts and empirical evidence that speaks to: the value of higher education for individuals and for societies; federal, state, and institutional financial aid policies; university budgets and spending priorities. We will consider individual student, institutional and societal perspectives.

The doctoral comprehensive examination in the Sociology of Education program is intended for students to achieve and demonstrate a comprehensive working knowledge of a large subfield of sociology. We trust that the knowledge facilitated by the exam will serve our students well as they write their dissertations and continue into subsequent stages of their careers. The exam consists of an oral examination in two areas: (1) a list of 18 books and articles that our program considers to be foundational to the field of Sociology of Education and (2) approximately 32 additional readings (for a total of approximately 50 readings on the comps list), both theoretical and empirical, in an area of the student’s specialization.

In this independent study, my goal was to review some of the key explanations for within-school achievement gaps in the sociology of education literature. I am particularly interested in texts discussing how school contexts and school characteristics contribute to or mitigate the production of academic inequality within schools. My literature review focuses on four key themes: (1) peer networks, (2) student course taking, (3) teacher expectations and (4) parental influence.
